# nsGUI

A front end GUI with API that asks the NSAPIv2 for XML Train Station data

This teamproject is the product of a few days of development and a relentless determination to eat some pizza (with fries). 
nsGUI provides a easy to navigate Graphical User Interface, that allows the user to ask the train station data of any train
station in the Netherlands.
